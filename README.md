# Steam Review Sentiment Analysis

Hello! This is a simple sentiment analysis project that uses steam reviews as a dataset. This project uses TF-IDF to transform the reviews for training the models. The machine learning models used are the following:

    - Logistic Regression
    - Naive Bayes
    - Support Vector Machines[^1]
    - Random Forest[^1]

[^1]: Takes too long to train. 
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  poetry init
```

Start the server

```bash
  python -m analytics
```

## Features

A simple menu in the cli is provided to easily navigate the program. This project is capable of:

    - Retrieving steam reviews by game_code.
    - Transformation of reviews to TF-IDF, including exporting and importing of the vectorizer.
    - Training models that find and use the best parameters using sklearn's GridSearchCV. Includes exporting and importing of the trained models.
    - Displaying the accuracy of the model with different model parameters using matplotlib.
    - Testing models with user-typed reviews.

Retraining models will be implemented next.
